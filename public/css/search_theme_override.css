/**
 * Add your search theme override style declarations in ./theme/search_theme_override.scss
 *
 * To see your styles render, first run `yarn install` to get the app dependencies,
 * then run `yarn start` to build the dev version of the search app.
 *
 * As you update and save ./theme/search_theme_override.scss, you should see the app
 * update accordingly.
 *
 * Once you're happy with the styles, you can either copy ./theme/search_theme_override.scss
 * or the compiled ./public/css/search_theme_override.css file and add it to your site
 * theme sass/css.
